If you followed the instruction, you&#39;ll be in the Paris on one of those chairs that never sit quiet level on the pavement. I hope it&#39;s still sunny. Across the bridge to your right hand you will see L&#39;Artsan Parfumeur. You should try the scent called Papillons Extreme. I always did think it would smell great on you. There are a few things I want to say and couldn&#39;t. Because you would have got all emotional and you wouldn&#39;t have let me finish. So,here it is. When your get back home, Michael Lawler will give you access to a bank account that contains enough to give you a new beginning. Don&#39;t start panicking. It&#39;s not enough for you to sit around for the rest of your life. But it should buy your freedom. At least from that little town we both call home. Live boldly, Clark. Push yourself. Don&#39;t settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has eased something for me. So,is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day you walked in with your sweet smile and your ridiculous clothes. And your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing your felt. Don&#39;t think of me too often. I don&#39;t want you getting sad. Just live well. Just live. I&#39;ll be walking beside you every step of the way.</p><p>Love,Will.</p>',12)])])}const c=t(s,[["render",n]]);export{y as __pageData,c as default};
